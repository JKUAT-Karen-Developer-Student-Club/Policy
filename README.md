# JKUAT Karen Developer Student Club Policy and Procedures

[Club Logo](Policy/Tech Logo.png)

The JKUAT Karen Student Developer Club is a student organization at the Jomo Kenyatta University of Agriculture and Technology(Karen Campus) which is focused on providing students with valuable, hands-on, extracurricular tech skills which cannot normally be acquired through coursework.
Founded in 2022, DSC facilitates student-run workshops, tutorials, demos, and presentations for students of all backgrounds and skill-levels.

DSC workshops are designed by passionate students and guest speakers to teach all manner of new technical skills.
These workshops are targeted at students who share a love of coding, and help to prepare for hackathons and events.

Anyone can sign up to run a workshop!
We believe that we learn best from our peers, and want experienced students to help expand the skillsets of Guelph Coders.
